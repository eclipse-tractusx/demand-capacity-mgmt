# Demand and Capacity Management

## Overview

The ever-changing landscape of the global economy, coupled with technological advancements and resource constraints, poses challenges for industries worldwide. Eclipse-Tractus-X, the host of components for a Catena-X network, facilitates a secure exchange of demand and capacity data among all partners within the automotive network, spanning from raw material suppliers to n-tier suppliers to car manufacturers.
Demand and capacity management (DCM) is based on a collaborative process. Those who are part of the Catena-X network can securely share their demand and capacity data with other collaborators: with suppliers just as much as with automotive manufacturers and recyclers.

### Resilient Supply Chains

Demand and Capacity Management (DCM) operates on a collaborative basis within the Catena-X network. Participants securely share their demand and capacity data, fostering collaboration among suppliers, automotive manufacturers, and recyclers. This ecosystem offers protected spaces with a shared view of data, enabling proactive responses to plan changes and deviations, fostering joint problem-solving.

Establishing such collaborative processes significantly enhances transparency and resilience within supply chains.

### Advantages for Everyone Involved

- Enhanced planning reliability and accuracy
- Increased transparency regarding demand and capacity, including fluctuations
- Early detection and avoidance of capacity bottlenecks
- Reduced under/overproduction through improved resource utilization
- Cost reduction by minimizing expensive re-planning and optimizing material procurement
- Improved delivery reliability and customer satisfaction
